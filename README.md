# Trigonometic Java Library

This project consists of raw implementation of standard Trig Functions, using the Taylor Series.

Techniques to use library have been exemplified in TestHarness.java. 

Inverse functions take normal x values and return them in radians.

All other functions x must be converted toDeg/toRadian depending on what format user wants answer to be in using helper methods and then PASSED INTO required function

Example: Sin degrees, convert x to degrees using helper func xToDegrees and pass into sin function. The answer will be in degrees. 

Example: Secant radians, convert x to radians using helper func xToRadian and pass into secant func. The answer will be in radians.
